* Updating Lounge
1. Use [[https://rollupjs.org/guide/en/][Rollup]] for bundling (why: [[https://medium.com/@PepsRyuu/why-i-use-rollup-and-not-webpack-e3ab163f4fd3]])
2. Rename project to Lounge
3. Fix problems
4. Write tests
5. Gradually convert to Typescript (move from compiled JS to TS)
   1. [X] domCursor
   2. [-] editor
   3. [ ] fingertree
6. Promote org-mode code so it's no longer "example" code
   1. Remove lazy from example
   2. Convert to Typescript
      1. [ ] docOrg
      2. [ ] example
      3. [ ] org
7. Update annotations, so views can persist across state changes
   1. Allows more practical embedding of Codemirror for src blocks
8. generalize rerendering to tree structure that allows documents
   1. Store already keeps clones so it is immutable at any given time
   2. parse document to create blocks
      1. documents should be the source of truth for their blocks
   3. allow creating blocks outside a document
      1. An object tree that gets rendered
      2. Nodes can contain documents
* To be done
** better updating in the exmaple
- only render necessary blocks
** better fancy markup in the example
- use handlebars?
- hide headline stars
- make code blocks fancier
- hide code boilerplate
** undo adapter for DataStore
- can plug it into a different store (like Meteor)
